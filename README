roda - ruby Open DisAssembler
=============================

roda is meant to be our take on the concept of IDA, the excellent
Interactive DisAssembler (http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/).

We aim for something more akin to gdb (backend with many frontends) that is open source and very easy to modify.

Ideally, the "command line" default interface will be a real
programming language (preferrably Ruby, maybe Python) with functions
to perform the kinds of operations you'd like to perform, so that
there is a transparent line between power use of the program and
extending it.

The name: roda (pronounced O-DA) means "circle" in Portuguese, and
specifically when people gather to practice Capoeira they form a
circle called "roda" in the middle of which people play. It is a
temporary code name.
